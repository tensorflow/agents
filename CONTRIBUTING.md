Interested in contributing to TF Agents? We appreciate all kinds
of help!

## Pull Requests

We gladly welcome [pull requests](
https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

Before making any changes, we recommend opening an issue (if it
doesn't already exist) and discussing your proposed changes. This will
let us give you advice on the proposed changes. If the changes are
minor, then feel free to make them without discussion.

Want to contribute but not sure of what? Here are a few suggestions:

1. Add a new example, colab, or tutorial.  These are a great way to familiarize
   yourself and others with TF Agents.


2. Solve an [existing issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/agents/issues).
  These range from low-level software bugs to higher-level design problems.
  Check out the label [good first issue](
  https://github.com/tensorflow/agents/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. After
a pull request is approved, we merge it. Note our merging process differs
from GitHub in that we pull and submit the change into an internal version
control system. This system automatically pushes a git commit to the GitHub
repository (with credit to the original author) and closes the pull request.

## Style

See the [TF Agents style guide](STYLE_GUIDE.md).

## Unit tests

All TF Agents code-paths must be unit-tested.  See existing unit tests for
recommended test setup.

Unit tests ensure new features (a) work correctly and (b) guard against future
breaking changes (thus lower maintenance costs).

To run existing unit-tests, use the command:


```shell
python setup.py test
```

from the root of the `tf_agents` repository, ideally inside a virtualenv.
The tests will run with CPU or GPU, depending on which version of TensorFlow
you have installed.
