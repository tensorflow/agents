  The while loop will run num_steps in the environment, only counting steps that
  result in an environment transition, i.e. (time_step, action, next_time_step).
  If a step results in environment resetting, i.e. time_step.is_last() and
  next_time_step.is_first() (traj.is_boundary()), this is not counted toward the
  num_steps.

  As environments run batched time_steps, the counters for all batch elements
  are summed, and execution stops when the total exceeds num_steps. When
  batch_size > 1, there is no guarantee that exactly num_steps are taken -- it
  may be more but never less.

  This termination condition can be overridden in subclasses by implementing the
  self._loop_condition_fn() method.
