    Args:
      root_dir: Main directory path where checkpoints, saved_models, and
        summaries will be written to.
      train_step: a scalar tf.int64 `tf.Variable` which will keep track of the
        number of train steps. This is used for artifacts created like
        summaries, or outputs in the root_dir.
      agent: `tf_agent.TFAgent` instance to train with.
      experience_dataset_fn: a function that will create an instance of a
        tf.data.Dataset used to sample experience for training. Required for
        using the Learner as is. Optional for subclass learners which take a new
        iterator each time when `learner.run` is called.
      after_train_strategy_step_fn: (Optional) callable of the form
        `fn(sample, loss)` which can be used for example to update priorities in
        a replay buffer where sample is pulled from the `experience_iterator`
        and loss is a `LossInfo` named tuple returned from the agent. This is
        called after every train step. It runs using `strategy.run(...)`.
      triggers: List of callables of the form `trigger(train_step)`. After every
        `run` call every trigger is called with the current `train_step` value
        as an np scalar.
      checkpoint_interval: Number of train steps in between checkpoints. Note
        these are placed into triggers and so a check to generate a checkpoint
        only occurs after every `run` call. Set to -1 to disable.  This only
        takes care of the checkpointing the training process.  Policies must be
        explicitly exported through triggers
      summary_interval: Number of train steps in between summaries. Note these
        are placed into triggers and so a check to generate a checkpoint only
        occurs after every `run` call.
      max_checkpoints_to_keep: Maximum number of checkpoints to keep around.
        These are used to recover from pre-emptions when training.
      use_kwargs_in_agent_train: If True the experience from the replay buffer
        is passed into the agent as kwargs. This requires samples from the RB to
        be of the form `dict(experience=experience, kwarg1=kwarg1, ...)`. This
        is useful if you have an agent with a custom argspec.
      strategy: (Optional) `tf.distribute.Strategy` to use during training.
