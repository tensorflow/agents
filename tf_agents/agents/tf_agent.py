  """Abstract base class for TF-based RL and Bandits agents.

  The agent serves the following purposes:

  * Training by reading minibatches of `experience`, and updating some set
    of network weights (using the `train` method).

  * Exposing `policy` objects which can be used to interact with an environment:
    either to explore and collect new training data, or to maximize reward
    in the given task.

  The agents' main training methods and properties are:

  * `initialize`: Perform any self-initialization before training.

  * `train`: This method reads minibatch experience from a replay buffer or
    logs on disk, and updates some internal networks.

  * `preprocess_sequence`: Some algorithms need to perform sequence
    preprocessing on logs containing "full episode" or "long subset" sequences,
    to create intermediate items that can then be used by `train`, even if
    `train` does not see the full sequences.  In many cases this is just
    the identity: it passes experience through untouched.  This function
    is typically passed to the argument

    `ReplayBuffer.as_dataset(..., sequence_preprocess_fn=...)`

  * `training_data_spec`: Property that describes the structure expected of
    the `experience` argument passed to `train`.

  * `train_sequence_length`: Property that describes the **second** dimension
    of all tensors in the `experience` argument passed `train`.  All tensors
    passed to train must have the shape `[batch_size, sequence_length, ...]`,
    and some Agents require this to be a fixed value.  For example, in regular
    `DQN`, this second `sequence_length` dimension must be equal to `2` in all
    `experience`.  In contrast, `n-step DQN` will have this equal to `n + 1` and
    `DQN` agents constructed with `RNN` networks will have this equal to `None`,
    meaning any length sequences are allowed.

    This value may be `None`, to mean minibatches containing subsequences of any
    length are allowed (so long as they're all the same length).  This is
    typically the case with agents constructed with `RNN` networks.

    This value is typically passed as a ReplayBuffer's
    `as_dataset(..., num_steps=...)` argument.

  * `collect_data_spec`: Property that describes the structure expected of
    experience collected by `agent.collect_policy`.  This is typically
    identical to `training_data_spec`, but may be different if
    `preprocess_sequence` method is not the identity.  In this case,
    `preprocess_sequence` is expected to read sequences matching
    `collect_data_spec` and emit sequences matching `training_data_spec`.

  The agent exposes `TFPolicy` objects for interacting with environments:

  * `policy`: Property that returns a policy meant for "exploiting" the
    environment to its best ability.  This tends to mean the "production" policy
    that doesn't collect additional info for training.  Works best when
    the agent is fully trained.

    TODO(b/154870654): Not all agents are properly exporting properly greedy
    "production" policies yet.  We have to clean this up.  In particular,
    we have to update PPO and SAC's `policy` objects.

  * `collect_policy`: Property that returns a policy meant for "exploring"
    the environment to collect more data for training.  This tends to mean
    a policy involves some level of randomized behavior and additional info
    logging.

  * `time_step_spec`: Property describing the observation and reward signatures
    of the environment this agent's policies operate in.

  * `action_spec`: Property describing the action signatures of the environment
    this agent's policies operate in.


  **NOTE**: For API consistency, subclasses are not allowed to override public
  methods of `TFAgent` class. Instead, they may implement the protected methods
  including `_initialize`, `_train`, and `_preprocess_sequence`. This
  public-calls-private convention allowed this base class to do things like
  properly add `spec` and shape checks, which provide users an easier experience
  when debugging their environments and networks.

      weights: (optional).  A `Tensor`, either `0-D` or shaped `[batch]`,
        containing weights to be used when calculating the total train loss.
        Weights are typically multiplied elementwise against the per-batch loss,
        but the implementation is up to the Agent.
      training: Whether this `loss` calculation is being used as part of
        training.  This affects layer computation paths like dropout and batch
        normalization.
      **kwargs: Additional arguments to `loss`.

    Returns:
        A `LossInfo` containing the loss *before* the training step is taken.
        In most cases, if `weights` is provided, the entries of this tuple will
        have been calculated with the weights.  Note that each Agent chooses
        its own method of applying weights.
