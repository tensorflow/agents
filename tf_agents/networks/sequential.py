  It is a TF-Agents network that should be used instead of

  having to pre-declare input and output shapes. In turn, this layer is usable
  as a preprocessing layer for TF Agents Networks, and can be exported via
  PolicySaver.

  Stateful Keras layers (e.g. LSTMCell, RNN, LSTM, TF-Agents DynamicUnroll)
  are all supported.  The `state_spec` of `Sequential` is a tuple whose
  length matches the number of stateful layers passed.  If no stateful layers
  or networks are passed to `Sequential` then `state_spec == ()`.

  Usage:
  ```python
  c = Sequential([layer1, layer2, layer3])
  output, next_state = c(inputs, state)
