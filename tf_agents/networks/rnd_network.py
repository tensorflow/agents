    """Creates an instance of `RNDNetwork`.

    Args:
      input_tensor_spec: A nest of `tensor_spec.TensorSpec` representing the
        input observations.
      action_spec: A nest of `tensor_spec.BoundedTensorSpec` representing the
        actions.
      preprocessing_layers: (Optional.) A nest of `tf.keras.layers.Layer`
        representing preprocessing for the different observations.
        All of these layers must not be already built. For more details see
        the documentation of `networks.EncodingNetwork`.
      preprocessing_combiner: (Optional.) A keras layer that takes a flat list
        of tensors and combines them. Good options include
        `tf.keras.layers.Add` and `tf.keras.layers.Concatenate(axis=-1)`.
        This layer must not be already built. For more details see
        the documentation of `networks.EncodingNetwork`.
      conv_layer_params: Optional list of convolution layers parameters, where
        each item is a length-three tuple indicating (filters, kernel_size,
        stride).
      fc_layer_params: Optional list of fully_connected parameters, where each
        item is the number of units in the layer.
      dropout_layer_params: Optional list of dropout layer parameters, where
        each item is the fraction of input units to drop. The dropout layers are
        interleaved with the fully connected layers; there is a dropout layer
        after each fully connected layer, except if the entry in the list is
        None. This list must have the same length of fc_layer_params, or be
        None.
      activation_fn: Activation function, e.g. tf.keras.activations.relu.
      kernel_initializer: Initializer to use for the kernels of the conv and
        dense layers. If none is provided a default variance_scaling_initializer
      batch_squash: If True the outer_ranks of the observation are squashed into
        the batch dimension. This allow encoding networks to be used with
        observations with shape [BxTx...].
      dtype: The dtype to use by the convolution and fully connected layers.
      name: A string representing name of the network.

    Raises:
      ValueError: If `input_tensor_spec` contains more than one observation. Or
        if `action_spec` contains more than one action.
