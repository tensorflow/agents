# Overview

This directory contains data and tutorials for programming TensorFlow Agents. 
Agents is a reinforcement learning software stack for artificial intelligence automation and programming.
Agents provides a collection of pre-built agents, along with the necessary tools and utilities to build, train, and evaluate reinforcement learning models using the TensorFlow framework.

The primary goal of TensorFlow Agents is to offer a convenient and standardized way for researchers and developers to experiment with various reinforcement learning algorithms without having to start from scratch. It integrates seamlessly with TensorFlow, taking advantage of its computational capabilities and efficiency for deep learning.

# Capabilities

1. Agents: The library offers a range of pre-implemented RL agents based on popular algorithms such as DQN (Deep Q-Networks), SAC (Soft Actor-Critic), PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), and more. These agents can be easily customized and used to solve different types of RL problems.
2. Environments: TensorFlow Agents supports a variety of RL environments, making it easy to interface with popular gym-based environments or custom environments. This flexibility allows users to adapt the RL algorithms to their specific tasks.
3. Networks: The library provides standard neural network architectures that can be used as function approximators in RL agents. Users can also customize network structures to suit their specific requirements.
4. Policies: TensorFlow Agents allows users to define different policies for agents, such as epsilon-greedy, Gaussian policies, etc., and easily switch between them during training and evaluation.
5. Replay Buffers: To facilitate experience replay, TensorFlow Agents offers replay buffers that store and sample experiences for efficient training of RL agents.
6. Training Utilities: The library comes with built-in training utilities that help manage training processes, saving and loading checkpoints, logging training metrics, and more.
7. Customizability: While providing pre-built agents, TensorFlow Agents also allows users to create and experiment with their custom RL algorithms. This flexibility is beneficial for advanced users who want to explore novel approaches.
8. Scalability: TensorFlow's underlying computational power enables TensorFlow Agents to efficiently handle large-scale RL tasks and accelerate training using hardware accelerators like GPUs or TPUs.
