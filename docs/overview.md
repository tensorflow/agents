# TensorFlow Agents

**Reinforcement Learning with TensorFlow**

Agents makes designing, implementing and testing new RL algorithms easier, by
providing well tested modular components that can be modified and extended. It
enables fast code iteration, with good test integration and benchmarking.

To get started, we recommend checking out one of our [tutorials](/tutorials).

## Installation

TF-Agents publishes nightly and stable builds. For a list of releases read the
<a href='#Releases'>Releases</a> section. The commands below cover installing
TF-Agents stable and nightly from [pypi.org](https://pypi.org) as well as from a
GitHub clone.

> :warning: If using Reverb (replay buffer), which is very common,
TF-Agents will only work with Linux.

> Note: Python 3.11 requires pygame 2.1.3+.

### Stable

Run the commands below to install the most recent stable release. API
documentation for the release is on
[tensorflow.org](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/api_docs/python/tf_agents).

```shell
$ pip install --user tf-agents[reverb]

# Use this tag get the matching examples and colabs.
$ git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/agents.git
$ cd agents
$ git checkout v0.18.0
```

If you want to install TF-Agents with versions of Tensorflow or
[Reverb](https://github.com/deepmind/reverb) that are flagged as not compatible
by the pip dependency check, use the following pattern below at your own risk.

```shell
$ pip install --user tensorflow
$ pip install --user dm-reverb
$ pip install --user tf-agents
```

If you want to use TF-Agents with TensorFlow 1.15 or 2.0, install version 0.3.0:

```shell
# Newer versions of tensorflow-probability require newer versions of TensorFlow.
$ pip install tensorflow-probability==0.8.0
$ pip install tf-agents==0.3.0
```

### Nightly

Nightly builds include newer features, but may be less stable than the versioned
releases. The nightly build is pushed as `tf-agents-nightly`. We suggest
installing nightly versions of TensorFlow (`tf-nightly`) and TensorFlow
Probability (`tfp-nightly`) as those are the versions TF-Agents nightly are
tested against.

To install the nightly build version, run the following:

```shell
# `--force-reinstall helps guarantee the right versions.
$ pip install --user --force-reinstall tf-nightly
$ pip install --user --force-reinstall tfp-nightly
$ pip install --user --force-reinstall dm-reverb-nightly

# Installing with the `--upgrade` flag ensures you'll get the latest version.
$ pip install --user --upgrade tf-agents-nightly
```

### From GitHub

After cloning the repository, the dependencies can be installed by running `pip
install -e .[tests]`. TensorFlow needs to be installed independently: `pip
install --user tf-nightly`.

## Releases

TF Agents has stable and nightly releases. The nightly releases are often fine
but can have issues due to upstream libraries being in flux. The table below
lists the version(s) of TensorFlow that align with each TF Agents' release.
Release versions of interest:

  * 0.18.0 dropped Python 3.8 support.
  * 0.16.0 is the first version to support Python 3.11.
  * 0.15.0 is the last release compatible with Python 3.7.
  * If using numpy < 1.19, then use TF-Agents 0.15.0 or earlier.
  * 0.9.0 is the last release compatible with Python 3.6.
  * 0.3.0 is the last release compatible with Python 2.x.
