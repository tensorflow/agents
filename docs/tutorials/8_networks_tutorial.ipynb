        "In this colab we will cover how to define custom networks for your agents. The networks help us define the model that is trained by agents. In TF-Agents you will find several different types of networks which are useful across agents:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Main Networks**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **QNetwork**: Used in Qlearning for environments with discrete actions, this network maps an observation to value estimates for each possible action.\n",
        "* **CriticNetworks**: Also referred to as `ValueNetworks` in literature, learns to estimate some version of a Value function mapping some state into an estimate for the expected return of a policy. These networks estimate how good the state the agent is currently in is.\n",
        "* **ActorNetworks**: Learn a mapping from observations to actions. These networks are usually used by our policies to generate actions.\n",
        "* **ActorDistributionNetworks**: Similar to `ActorNetworks` but these generate a distribution which a policy can then sample to generate actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Helper Networks**\n",
        "* **EncodingNetwork**: Allows users to easily define a mapping of pre-processing layers to apply to a network's input.\n",
        "* **DynamicUnrollLayer**: Automatically resets the network's state on episode boundaries as it is applied over a time sequence.\n",
        "* **ProjectionNetwork**: Networks like `CategoricalProjectionNetwork` or `NormalProjectionNetwork` take inputs and generate the required parameters to generate Categorical, or Normal distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "All examples in TF-Agents come with pre-configured networks. However these networks are not setup to handle complex observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you have an environment which exposes more than one observation/action and you need to customize your networks then this tutorial is for you!"
