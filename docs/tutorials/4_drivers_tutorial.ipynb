        "\n",
        "While this is relatively straightforward to write in python, it is much more complex to write and debug in TensorFlow because it involves `tf.while` loops, `tf.cond` and `tf.control_dependencies`. Therefore we abstract this notion of a run loop into a class called `driver`, and provide well tested implementations both in Python and TensorFlow.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, the data encountered by the driver at each step is saved in a named tuple called Trajectory and broadcast to a set of observers such as replay buffers and metrics. This data includes the observation from the environment, the action recommended by the policy, the reward obtained, the type of the current and the next step, etc."
