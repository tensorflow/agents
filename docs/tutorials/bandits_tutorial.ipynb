        "The Multi-Armed Bandit problem (MAB) is a special case of Reinforcement Learning: an agent collects rewards in an environment by taking some actions after observing some state of the environment. The main difference between general RL and MAB is that in MAB, we assume that the action taken by the agent does not influence the next state of the environment. Therefore, agents do not model state transitions, credit rewards to past actions, or \"plan ahead\" to get to reward-rich states.\n",
        "\n",
        "As in other RL domains, the goal of a MAB *agent* is to find a *policy* that collects as much reward as possible. It would be a mistake, however, to always try to exploit the action that promises the highest reward, because then there is a chance that we miss out on better actions if we do not explore enough. This is the main problem to be solved in (MAB), often called the *exploration-exploitation dilemma*.\n",

The [RegretMetric](https://github.com/tensorflow/agents/blob/master/tf_agents/bandits/metrics/tf_metrics.py) thus needs a *baseline_reward_fn* function that calculates the best achievable expected reward given an observation.

For example, the agent's `train` function is only called once per iteration. The trade-off here is that if we train more often then our policy is \"fresher\", on the other hand, training in bigger batches might be more time efficient."
